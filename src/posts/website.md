## Overview
**Developing a personal website was a perfect opportunity to put my skills into action.** It was a fun project I did over the summer holidays where I learned about using Gatsby for the first time and allowed myself to showcase my projects I accomplished so far!
## Why a personal website?
Like most other people, creating a personal website is another avenue where you could showcase your projects or share your thoughts out there. Not only that but online users can find inspiration in visiting a personal website through seeing other individual's projects, blog posts or even guides.

For myself, I wanted to accomplish something productive over my summer holidays and developing my own personal website seems like a fun project to do. I wanted a place where I can showcase my projects I completed so far, express my ideas and increase my online presence!

## Layout and Design
I would say I'm not the best in coming up with amazing UI/UX design so it was a challenge coming up with a good layout for my website. The design process took multiple iterations to generate ideas on the direction I wanted to go with my website. I knew for certain that I want my Home page to showcase my top projects and blog posts immediately when users visit my website.

In this design process, I used [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) to sketch up several design prototypes. One design prototype I had planned on using before changing up to what you see now is shown below.

After thinking it over, I decided to go with a simplistic design to what you see now. Some design concepts were used from the Figma prototype such as the use of cards to display items.

## Building the Website
There was so many options I could have chose to build my website. Few options I considered were using basic HTML/CSS, React or Jekyll. However, after some thought, I decided to use React with Gatsby. Gatsby is able to render markdown documents to HTML which allows myself to write blog posts or projects in markdown. This made it much more easier for any edits that needs to be made. Gatsby then is able to generate separate pages for each markdown document. It also giving me flexibility to come up with my own design and components using Gatsby *(it was also a good opportunity to explore a new framework and practice using React)*
## Domain Name and Hosting
It was my first time dealing with hosting and buying a domain name when developing my website. Some places that was suggested to buy a domain name was GoDaddy however after some research on it, I found that it was more expensive than other domain registrar with less features included *(you have to pay for WHOIS privacy unlike other domain registrars)*. I decided to go with [Dynadot](https://www.dynadot.com/) to buy my domain names but other domain registrars such as [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) would be good options as well.

For hosting, I used [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to host my website as it was free to use and works perfectly with the github actions workflow I set up in my website repository, where any changes in master automatically gets deployed on the website.

I also used [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) to link my domain to as it allows me the network congestion and traffic for my website. It also prevents any potential DDoS attacks.

## Future Developments
There is still so much I want to do with my personal website *(such as writing more blog posts and improve the website theme)*. For now, my personal website has most of the features I wanted and it just a little cleaning here and there of the website that needs to be done! :)
