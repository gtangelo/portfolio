# Portfolio
This repository serves as the codebase for my own portfolio website. Currently, there is a github actions workflow set in place. Everytime a push has been made to the `main` branch, changes are reflected in the deployed website. Website can be access by the following url: https://gtangelo.github.io/portfolio/

## Tech Stack
- My portfolio website was created using React with the Gatsby framework.
- Website was deployed using Github pages
## Getting Started

## File Structure
1.  **`/node_modules`**: contains all of the modules of code that your project depends on (npm packages)

2.  **`/src`**: contains all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site.

3.  **`gatsby-config.js`**: main configuration file for a Gatsby site. This is where you can specify information about your site (metadata) like the site title and description, which Gatsby plugins youâ€™d like to include, etc. (Check out the [config docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/gatsby-config/) for more detail).

4.  **`gatsby-node.js`**: This file is where Gatsby expects to find any usage of the [Gatsby Node APIs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/node-apis/) (if any). These allow customization/extension of default Gatsby settings affecting pieces of the site build process.
